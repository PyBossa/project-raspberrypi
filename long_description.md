## WHAT & WHY

This project is a demo and at the same time a real project. This project uses the
command line tool [Raspberry Pi Trapcamera](https://github.com/PyBossa/rasberrypi-trapcamera)
to take pictures through a window with the goal of finding if there are bees or wasps living
outside of this house in the center of Madrid, Spain.

The Raspberry Pi camera takes pictures every 5 minutes, uploads them to Flickr and creates
a task in this project so people like you can help to find out if there are bees or wasps
living outside of this house.

## HOW

You can easily help by classifying the pictures that could have a bee or a wasp in the picture.

The project will show you a picture, and you'll have to answer only if you see a wasp or a bee.

## WHO

SciFabric, the company that develops PyBossa and hosts Crowdcrafting.

## KEEP TRACK
