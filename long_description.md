## WHAT & WHY

This project is a demo and at the same time a real project. This project uses the
command line tool [Raspberry Pi Trapcamera](https://github.com/PyBossa/rasberrypi-trapcamera)
to take pictures through a window with the goal of finding if there are bees or wasps living
outside of this house in the center of Madrid, Spain.

Why not looking directly? Because it is the 5th floor of a building, and going out and finding out is, to say the least, risky. As a solution, we've placed the Raspberry Pi camera looking through that window, with the hope that the bees/wasp show in front of it (we know there are one of those because we've seen them).

The Raspberry Pi camera takes pictures every 5 minutes, uploads them to Flickr and creates
a task in this project so people like you can help to find out if there are bees or wasps
living outside of this house.

## HOW

You can easily help by classifying the pictures that could have a bee or a wasp in the picture.

The project will show you a picture, and you'll have to answer only if you see a wasp or a bee.

## WHO

SciFabric, the company that develops PyBossa and hosts Crowdcrafting.
